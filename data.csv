Have you received any awards or recognitions?,I have received multiple client and company recognitions during my time at Accenture and Genpact.
my own innovation that i am super proud off,The scrubbing tool that was leveraged to remove sensitive client information from documents.
Describe a challenging situation at work and how you handled it.,"**Situation 1**  
**Task:** During my tenure at Accenture, there was a requirement to improve the scrubbing process, which was consuming up to 20 hours of resources per week.  

**Issue:** The tool needed to accurately identify and remove sensitive data from various documents, using only the company name for which the sanitization was required.

**Action:** I initiated the development of a robust scrubbing tool that leveraged NLP concepts to identify personal information within documents. I also integrated Google's logo recognition, using these images to train a logo detection model that further enhanced the accuracy of document scrubbing.

**Result:** The tool achieved over 85% precision, and manual efforts were reduced by more than 90%.

---

**Situation 2**  
**Situation:** During my tenure at Genpact, while working for a retail company, we needed to address the cannibalistic effect of similar articles on each other and accurately identify the actual low-performing articles.

**Issue:** My responsibility was to ensure the project analyzed the data correctly without mistakenly flagging articles. For instance, an article might have a low consumer base due to its niche, not because of poor performance.

**Action:** I led a collaborative effort to analyze and categorize the articles across different groups to accurately identify low-performing items. We conducted continuous testing and communicated effectively with the team and stakeholders.

**Result:** Through these actions, we successfully identified the bottom five low-performing articles, allowing the client to discontinue them. This resulted in an approximate $5 million increase in revenue.

Tell me about your experience at Accenture?,"At Accenture, I worked closely with a US healthcare client, where I was tasked with streamlining processes around data privacy and automation. One of my proudest achievements was leading the development of a scrubbing tool that used machine learning and Python to handle sensitive information in thousands of documents. It was a complex project because it required both precision and scalability, but the end result significantly reduced the manual work involved. Over time, I iterated on the solution, incorporating advanced image classification techniques like CNN and YOLO, which further improved the efficiency of the tool.

What I enjoyed most about this experience was seeing how the integration of AI could drastically improve operational efficiency. It wasn't just about building a technical solution; it was about understanding the pain points of the business and creating something that really addressed those challenges."
Tell me about your experience at  Enquero - Genpact?,"At Genpact, I had the opportunity to work in a dynamic environment for a major retail client. My role focused on driving insights from vast datasets and improving decision-making processes. One of the more rewarding aspects was developing machine learning models that helped the client reduce redundancy in their product catalog, which led to measurable financial impacts like increasing profits by around 5%. What really excited me about this project was how we were able to translate a technical solution into real-world business value, something that made a tangible difference for the client.

Beyond the technical work, I also found great value in mentoring and training interns. It gave me a chance to step into a leadership role and contribute to their growth, especially around complex areas like deep learning. The balance between technical problem-solving and people leadership was an aspect of this role that I truly appreciated.
